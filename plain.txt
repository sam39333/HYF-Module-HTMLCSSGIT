create a file by touch test.txt
to hide the file we just created we use (.) infront of the file name
.test.txt this will hide the file
if we want to view a hidden file we use ls -a to display list of files including hidden files
to create nestled directories we mkdir -p this will help us to create the parent direcories and create multiple files inside it
$ mkdir -p /c/Users/name/these/folders/are/just/for/fun

we can use the echo text; echo test; echo hello;
echo will help us create new line without using the newline command but by using;.
ls
